A software laser server with GUI for up to 4 lasers live actions. Think creative like Laser "battles", planetarium, sharing available lasers in demoparties for competition, ... 

 

LJ has 5 main components : 

- "Plugins" are points generators (to one or more lasers). Lot examples comes with LJ : planetarium, 3D anaglyph animations,... See plugins directory.
- A "tracer" per etherdream/laser that take its given point list, correct geometry, recompute in laser controller coordinates, send it to its controller and report its status to the "manager".
- A "manager" that talk to all tracers (which client number point lists to draw, new geometry correction,...), handle IOs (webui functions, OSC commands,...) and plugins.
- A web GUI in html, css, and vanilla js. No html server or js framework here : it's complex enough. This GUI has a (currently slow) simulator, but one can used a builtin python simulator (pysimu) or an etherdream/laser emulator (from nannou) to work without physical lasers !! 
- A network available database (redis). "Plugins" send directly their pointlists to redis and each "tracer" is instructed to get one of the avalaible pointlist in redis. See details right below...


More details :

LJ server accept up to 4 groups = virtual "scenes" of 4 "pointlists" so up to 16 pointlists can be sent to redis at anytime from anywhere in the network. You select in WebUI (Simu/plugins matrix) wich "scene" should be used by tracers/lasers. The all point is to easily share actual lasers. Imagine in demo party :

Erica needs 4 lasers, that's the 4 pointlists of a "scene".
Paula and Jennifer use only 2 lasers each, so they can share a "scene".
And so on..

The server/network/webUI idea allows to spread cpu intensive tasks on different cpu cores and especially give tracers enough cpu to feed etherdreams DACs smoothly. Of course all this can happen in one computer. There is no real limits : 4 everything is tested and works smoothly if *you have enough cpu/computers/network ressources*. 

It's obviously overkill for one laser in a garage, but for several laserS games events, laserS art, laserS competition, laserS planetarium,... LJ will handle the complexity. Content providers like artists, demomakers,... just need create plugin in whatever langage, send the points to redis. Then use the webui to select the "scene". 

Registering the plugin in LJ.conf is absolutely not mandatory. 

Needs at least : an etherdream DAC connected to an ILDA laser, RJ 45 IP network (gigabits only !! wifi and wired 100 mpbs doesn't work well with several lasers). Seriously : if you experience frame dropsÂ you need to upgrade your network. 

LJ is tested with Firefox, supports Linux and OS X. Windows is unkown but welcome, if someone want to jump in. 

LJ is in dev : versions in this repository will always be core functionnal : accept and draw pointlists. New features can be not fully implemented, wait for the next commit. Any feedback is welcome at any time.



#
# Features among many others.
# 

(Doc in progress)

- Laser alignment like in videomapping.
- OSC and websocket commands. Very cool : LJ can script or be scripted.
- Web ui : In your browser open webui/index.html. Javascript is needed. By default it connect to localhost. If you want to control a remote server, you need to change the uri line in LJ.js.
- Status update every 0.5 seconds : every etherdream DAC state, number of buffer points sent,...
- "Optimisation" points automatically added, can be changed live for glitch art. Search "resampler" commands.
- A compiled version for os x and linux of nannou.org etherdream+laser emulator is included. For more informations, like license see https://github.com/nannou-org/ether-dream
- Some fancy examples are available : 3D anaglyph, Laser Pong,...
- Midi and audio reactive, look midigen.py and fft3.py
- Openpose skeletons animations laser player.
- Resolume OSC client.
- Another project (bhorpad) has been merged in LJ : so if you a led matrix, like Launchpad mini or bhoreal, plug it you may define, launch macros as pushing on one led or use them to display informations.
- Artnet plugin.
- Maxwell laser synth emulation plugin.



#
# Install 
#

With Linux, type in a terminal window :

./install.sh

For OS X, you need brew already installed, then :

brew update
brew upgrade
brew install redis
type all install.sh commands beginning line 4. An OS X install script soon !!

For Linux and OS X :

You probably want redis bound to all network interfaces : comment the bind line in /etc/redis/redis.conf and restart it.

In webui/index.html change the websocket (ws) ip adress to the server IP if needed.

Using the same idea check all ip address in LJ.conf.

There is a nice websocket debug tool : websocat.



#
# To run
#

Correct launch order is :

- Switch on Dac/Laser (emulator or IRL)
- Redis server once : i.e redis-server &
- This server. see below.
- Load/reload webUI page from disk in a browser (webui/index.html). Javascript must be enabled.
- Run a builtin plugin or your generator, to send pointlists in redis. See in clients/plugins folder for examples.


A typical LJ server start is python main.py -L numberoflasers. 
Use also -h to display all possible arguments, like -v for debug informations.


CASE 1 : the laser server computer is the same that the computer running a generator/plugin :


1/ Run LJ

python main.py -L 1

2/ Check in your client code if the laser server IP is the good one

Run your client

3/ to monitor redis server, there is an app for that (redis-manager/medis/...) or :
redis-cli monitor



CASE 2 : Server and Client computers are different :


1/ Say the laser server computer (running LJ) IP is 192.138.1.13, the client computer is 192.168.1.52, First remember to check on the server computer if the redis server is listening to the right IP :

edit /etc/redis/redis.conf

2/ Launch LJ with -r argument :
python main.py -r 192.168.1.13 -L 1

3/ If the webUI is launched on "client" computer, update uri line in LJ.js

4/ run a client/plugin on client computer, like :

node nodeclient.js

5/ to monitor redis server use redis-manager/medis/... or :

redis-cli -h redisserverIP monitor


#
# Plugins 
#

A "plugin" is a software that send any number of pointlist(s). LJ comes with different plugins in python 3 :

- LiveWords 	: Fill the input form and it's displayed. One word / laser.
- Textcycl		: Cycle some words with adjustable length on one laser.
- Anaglyph  	: A green/red rotating cube. Try it with green/red 3D glasses !
- Planetarium 	: A 4 lasers planetarium.
- pySimu 		: A full speed laser simulator (pygame, python 2.7)
- LaserPong		: Our laser Pong is back ! (python 2.7)
- Pose 			: Display json openpose skeleton animations ans starfields
- fft3          : Example how to make LJ audio reactive
- maxwell 		: A laser synth inspired by bluefang great work.

#
# Client Side : Program your own "plugin" 
#


The server approach is based on redis, so you write and run your laser client software in any redis capable programming langage (50+ : https://redis.io/clients). An external program that just send pointlists is a "client". If you want some interactions from the webUI, like text status area support, crash detection, launch,... it's a "plugin" and some default code is needed see square.py as example and :

- Read all this readme ;-)
- There is a client and plugin folders with examples in different languages. If you want to do game, especially with pygame, see ljpong in plugins/games directory.
- Generate at least one point list array (say a square) with *enough points*, one point is likely to fail for buffering reason.
- Feed your point list array in string format to redis server. i.e use "/pl/0/1" redis key to feed scene 0, pointlist 1.
- Tell LJ.conf your plugin configuration : OSC port and command line to start it.

Currently the WebUI (webui/index.html) is static so it has to be modified 'manually' and build : run python build.py in webui directory.

# Client side dope mode : How to use lj23
# 

lj23 have many very useful functions to not reinvent the wheel for advanced point generation "client" side : layers, built in rotations,..
 

4 Great TRICKS with lj23.
First open square.py and learn how to declare different objects. square.py is a 2D shape example in 3D rotation (red/green anaglyph rendering) that use 2 layers : one left eye and one for right eye.


1/ How to have another laser drawing the same thing ?

That's a destination problem : just add another destination !

Dest1 = lj.DestObject('1', 1, True, 0 , 1, 1)	# Dest1 will also send layer 0 points to scene 1, laser 1 



2/ Different layers to different lasers ?

Say because of too much points you want Left element drawn by scene 0, laser 0 and right element by scene 0, laser 1

First define a different object/layer for each drawn element :

Leftsquare = lj.FixedObject('Leftsquare', True, 255, [], red, 255, 0, 0, 0 , True)		 # Left goes to layer 0
Rightsquare = lj.FixedObject('Rightsquare', True, 255, [], green, 0, 255, 0, 1 , True)	 # Right goes to layer 1

Define 2 destinations :

Dest0 = lj.DestObject('0', 0, True, 0 , 0, 0) 	# Dest0 will send layer 0 points to scene 0, laser 0 
Dest1 = lj.DestObject('1', 1, True, 1 , 0, 1)	# Dest1 will send layer 1 points to scene 0, laser 1 



3/ Different layers to one laser ?

You should consider adding all your points to one layer, but same as 1/ it's a destination problem, just add another destination with the same scene/laser for this layer

Dest1 = lj.DestObject('1', 1, True, 1 , 0, 0)	# Dest1 will also send layer 1 points to scene 0, laser 0 



4/ I want to animate/modify anything on the fly : I'm doing a game and suddenly my hero change color.

It's a declared object problem : say Hero is a Fixed Object, you can directly change value of 

Hero.name, Hero.active, Hero.intensity, Hero.xy, Hero.color, Hero.red, Hero.green, Hero.blue, Hero.layer, Hero.closed

For a character vanishing in one point use a relativeObject so you can decrease resize parameter,...
PNC.name, PNC.active, PNC.intensity, PNC.xy, PNC.color, PNC.red, PNC.green, PNC.blue, PNC.layer, PNC.closed, PNC.xpos, PNC.ypos, PNC.resize, PNC.rotx, PNC.roty, PNC.rotz

Remember RelativeObject points 'objectname.xy' has to be around 0,0,0. The other properties let you change the actual position (xpos, ypos), resize,..


Same for Dest0 if it's a destObject, properties are :
Dest0.name, Dest0.number, Dest0.active, Dest0.layer, Dest0.scene, Dest0.laser


DrawDests() will take care of all your declared drawn elements/"objects" and Destinations to generate a point list per scene/laser sent to redis. In client point of view a "pointlist" is the sum of all its declared "layers".

#
# Networking
#


LJ is network based and this is *critical and flickering reason #1* if not managed properly, especially if you have several lasers.

Our "always working solution", as we regularly move our gear for different venues :

- We use static network configuration. Our Etherdreams controllers have static IPs defined in their SDcard from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.9. 

- Because wifi will always finally sucks for many reasons, our computers (laser server and clients) are *gigabits wired* with 192.168.1.10 and after. Don't trust end user gear marketing on wifi. We have a big gigabits switch for the *laser only lan*. We provide Internet through wifi on a different network like 192.168.2.x if really needed.

- Again, even if etherdreams are 100 Mbits, we use *gigabits* gear.


By default LJ uses on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) :

- A websocket on port 9001 for WebUI interaction.
- The redis server on port 6379 ('ljayserverip')
- An OSC server on port 8002 for remote control via OSC and plugins.
- Some OSC clients defined in LJ.conf to forward commands to defined plugins


You need to update LJ.conf to your network/etherdreams IPs and be sure to check command arguments : python main.py --help

The need for a dedicated computer to act as "laser server" usually depends on how many lasers you want to control and your main computer load. If you seen flickering with small point lists, try the dedicated computer idea and/or stop process interfering like redis monitoring,...

# Ether dream configuration
#

![Etherdream Laser DAC](https://www.ether-dream.com/ed2-external.jpg)

This program suppose that the ether dream is configured in a certain way especially for its IP address. We write an autoplay.txt file inside an SD Card within the ether dream DAC, with the following lines you can adjust i.e for pps or fps. Yes, there is a builtin DHCP client in the ether dream DAC but if you run multiple lasers, having a fixed dedicated network makes you focus on laser stuff.

/net/ipaddr 192.168.1.3

/net/netmask 255.255.255.0

/net/gateway 192.168.1.10

/ilda/pps 25000

/ilda/fps 25

About hardware setup, especially if you have several lasers : ILDA cables are insanely expensive. You may consider the Power Over Ethernet 'POE' option. Buy a very small ILDA cable, a POE splitter and connect everything to the ether dream fixed near your laser. You can have then a simple and very long network cable and use a Power Over Ethernet injector or switch close to the driving computer. Beware some vendors use 24V POE Injector : POE injectors and splitters must match.
